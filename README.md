# Web Hosting and Domain Name

This project requires a proper setup to make the website accessible online. Below is an explanation of the key components:

## 1. Domain Name
A **domain name** is the unique address that represents your website on the internet (e.g., `www.example.com`).  
- It is your identity or brand online.
- Choose a name that is memorable, relevant, and easy to spell.
- Register the domain name through a domain registrar to secure ownership.

## 2. Web Hosting
**Web hosting** is the service that stores your website’s files and makes them accessible to visitors online.  
- Select a **reliable hosting provider** that ensures good performance, uptime, and support.
- Hosting plans may include features like storage space, bandwidth, email accounts, and security options.
- Once your files are uploaded to the host, your website becomes live and accessible through your domain name.
