                    <h2>Early Years in Eldoret</h2>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Eldoret, a vibrant town in the Rift Valley region of Kenya known for its high-altitude training grounds for world-class athletes. My childhood was filled with the beautiful scenery of the Kenyan highlands and the warm community spirit that defines our town.</p>
                    
                    <p>Growing up in a family of five, I learned the values of sharing, responsibility, and hard work from an early age. My parents, both educators, instilled in me the importance of knowledge and curiosity about the world around me.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Formative Experiences</h3>
                    <p>One of my most memorable childhood experiences was our annual family trips to the surrounding natural attractions like the Kerio Valley and Chepkiit Waterfalls. These adventures nurtured my love for nature and exploration.</p>
                    
                    <p>I also fondly remember participating in local community events and church activities, which taught me the importance of community involvement and service to others.</p>

                    <h2>Family Influence</h2>
                    <p>My family played a crucial role in shaping my character. My father, a mathematics teacher, introduced me to problem-solving and logical thinking through simple puzzles and games. My mother, an English teacher, cultivated my love for reading and storytelling.</p>
                    
                    <p>I have two siblings - an older sister who is now a nurse and a younger brother still in high school. Our family dinners were always filled with lively discussions about current events, books we were reading, and our daily experiences.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Early Interest in Technology</h3>
                    <p>My first encounter with a computer was at age 10 when my father brought home a used desktop computer. I was fascinated by this machine and spent hours exploring its capabilities, which sparked my initial interest in technology.</p>
                    
                    <p>By age 16, I had taught myself basic HTML by reading books from the local library and experimenting with creating simple web pages about my favorite topics.</p>
